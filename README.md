## 📊 Credit Card Fraud Detection - Machine Learning Project

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised ML techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

### 🔧 Tech Stack:
- Python, Jupyter
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 🔍 Dataset:
[Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

- 284,807 transactions
- Highly imbalanced (0.17% fraud cases)
- Features are anonymized (`V1`–`V28`) + `Amount`, `Time`

### 🧠 Models Trained:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### 📈 Metrics:
- **Recall** is the key metric (we want to catch frauds)
- ROC AUC Score used for comparison
